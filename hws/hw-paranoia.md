ICS: Written Homework: Rational Paranoia
==========================================

[Go up to the ICS HW page](index.html) ([md](index.md))

You will want to see the [homeworks policies page](../uva/hw-policies.html)
([md](../uva/hw-policies.md)) for formatting and other details.  The due
dates are listed on the [UVa course page](../uva/index.html)
([md](../uva/index.md)).

### Assignment

For each of the three total scenarios (two from our list, one of your
own, as explained below), imagine that you are in charge of
security. Apply the security mindset (discussed in the [security slide
set](../slides/security-mindset.html#/)) to answer these questions:

- *What assets are important for you to protect?*
- *What security threats will you choose to defend against?*
- *What countermeasures can you justify, in terms of costs and benefits?*
	
Answer each of the above in the form of a bulleted list, with brief
justifications or explanations as necessary. State any critical
assumptions you decide to make. Your grade will be based on the
thoroughness, realism, and thoughtfulness of your analysis.  We are
more interested in quality than quantity.  But if you want a length
estimate, then one or two sentences for each "brief_explanation",
below, is reasonable.  That being said, as long as you are being
concise and not adding in fluff (see [here](../uva/hw-policies.html)
([md](../uva/hw-policies.md)) for a definition of fluff), they can be
longer.

Pick two of the following scenarios. (If you answer more, we'll
only grade the first two)

- You are in charge of protecting the water supply to a town or city, which is sourced from a reservoir that is publicly usable.
- A huge political rally will be held on Grounds, and you are in charge of ensuring it's security (no politicians will be present, though).
- You are asked to design the security for the goods crossing the English Channel after the currently stated Brexit deadline of October 31st.
- You are tasked with creating a policy to ensure the secure voting in the 2020 presidential election.
- You are asked to design a means to prevent private drones (the types that you can buy on Amazon for very little) from flying near airplanes -- a concern is if they were used to attack an airplane by being injested into an engine.

In addition, choose another scenario from everyday life that we
haven't discussed in class.  Your choice can be directly related to
computer security, but it does not have to be.

### Submission Template

Obviously reformat this in your word processor of choice.  The file to
be submitted **MUST BE A PDF DOCUMENT**.  Please name it `mst3k.pdf`,
