ICS: Written Homework: Rational Paranoia
==========================================

[Go up to the ICS HW page](index.html) ([md](index.md))

You will want to see the [homeworks policies page](../uva/hw-policies.html)
([md](../uva/hw-policies.md)) for formatting and other details.  The due
dates are listed on the [UVa course page](../uva/index.html)
([md](../uva/index.md)).

### Assignment

For each of the three total scenarios (two from our list, one of your
own, as explained below), imagine that you are in charge of
security. Apply the security mindset (discussed in the
[security slide set](../slides/security.html#/)) to answer these
questions:

- *What assets are important for you to protect?*
- *What security threats will you choose to defend against?*
- *What countermeasures can you justify, in terms of costs and benefits?*
	
Answer each of the above in the form of a bulleted list, with brief
justifications or explanations as necessary. State any critical
assumptions you decide to make. Your grade will be based on the
thoroughness, realism, and thoughtfulness of your analysis.  We are
more interested in quality than quantity.  But if you want a length
estimate, then one or two sentences for each "brief_explanation", below, is
reasonable.

Pick two of the following scenarios. (If you answer more, we'll
ignore the last one(s))

a. You have to plan for the next anniversary of the [Unite the Right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unite_the_Right_rally) rally, again in Charlottesville
b. You are hired by [WillowTree](https://willowtreeapps.com/) to help secure their servers from corporate espionage
c. You are grading homework 1 submissions for a class of 80 students
d. You are in charge of the security for a home football game here at UVa
e. You are in charge of making an election voting system that is both secure and has auditing capabilities

In addition, choose another scenario from everyday life that we
haven't discussed in class.  Your choice may be directly related to
computer security, but it does not have to be.
