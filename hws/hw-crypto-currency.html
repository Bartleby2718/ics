<h1 id="ics-programming-homework-cryptocurrency">ICS: Programming Homework: Cryptocurrency</h1>
<p><a href="index.html">Go up to the ICS HW page</a> (<a href="index.md">md</a>)</p>
<p>You must design your own cryptocurrency! Your implementation must be secure enough that you could actually use it.</p>
<p>You may use any programming language for this, but if you want to use a language other than C, C++, Java, or Python, please check with us first.</p>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Your cryptocurrency should have a name -- ideally, think of a neat name, but make sure it is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cryptocurrencies">not already taken</a>. It will have to use public/private key encryption to generate the wallets. You do not have to use symmetric encryption (such as AES) to protect the private key in the wallet. You will need to use a good hashing algorithm. In practice, SHA-256 would be the minimum, but you can use a shorter SHA hash for this assignment.</p>
<p>The intent is not for you to write the hashing or encryption / decryption routines -- use existing libraries for that. In particular, both Java and Python can do that for you. Be careful about requiring an uncommon Python module, Java library, or C/C++ library, as it still has to run on the submission server.</p>
<p>Some libraries will be installed for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python: we will install the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/rsa/">rsa</a> package; hashes in Python are in hashlib, which is part of the Python installation. Note that you have to use Python 3 for this assignment if you are using Python; the version installed on the submission server is 3.5.2.</li>
<li>Java: RSA and SHA are already in the standard Java library; you can look <a href="https://gist.github.com/dmydlarz/32c58f537bb7e0ab9ebf">here</a> for how to handle RSA in Java, and see the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/security/MessageDigest.html">MessageDigest class</a> for SHA (and the example <a href="https://www.baeldung.com/sha-256-hashing-java">here</a>). An example about how to sign a message can be found <a href="https://niels.nu/blog/2016/java-rsa.html">here</a>. The Java version on the submission server is 1.8.</li>
<li>C/C++: Boost is installed, as well as the openssl library. There are many great things about C and C++, but we think this will give you a real headache if you try to implement it in C or C++.</li>
</ul>
<p>One option will be to copy how Bitcoin handles these functions, as described in the <a href="../slides/cryptocurrency.html#/">Cryptocurrency slide set</a> slide set. However, coming up with new ideas will get you more points on the assignment.</p>
<h3 id="file-format">File format</h3>
<p><strong>Blockchain</strong></p>
<p>The blockchain will be in files named <code>block_0.txt</code>, <code>block_1.txt</code>, etc. The zeroth block will be the genesis block, and will not have any actual transactions in it. Each successive block will be of the following format:</p>
<ul>
<li>Line 1 will be the hash of the previous block</li>
<li>Lines 2 and beyond will be a transaction record (which is <em>not</em> the same as a transaction statement), one per line</li>
</ul>
<p>When generating the next block, you can assume that the previous block file exists. This means that we will generate the genesis block <code>block_0.txt</code> from the <code>genesis</code> command, below. Note that we are not dealing with nonces in this assignment.</p>
<p><strong>Ledger</strong></p>
<p>The blocks described above represent transactions that have been completed. Pending transaction records are to be placed in the ledger, which we will appropriately call <code>ledger.txt</code>. One of the functionalities that you have to implement is the transfer of the transaction records in the ledger into a block in the block chain.</p>
<p>Each line will be of the form <code>S transfers x to D</code>, where S is the source wallet, D is the destination wallet, and x is the (floating point) amount to transfer. You can have additional information after the required text, but it must all be on the same line. This is important -- each transaction record in the ledger must be exactly one line!</p>
<p><strong>Transaction statement versus transaction record</strong></p>
<p>A transaction <em>statement</em> is a multi-line text file that contains the sender, the recipient, the amount, and ends with a digital signature. Each transaction statement will be in its own file.</p>
<p>A transaction <em>record</em> is a single line in a ledger (and, later, in a block in the blockchain) that contains similar information, but on a single line.</p>
<p>Another of the functionalities that you will have to implement is the verification of a transaction record (checking it's signature and that there is enough money), which will then insert a single transaction record for that transaction into the ledger.</p>
<h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>
<p>Since this can be done in any programming language, you will have to write a shell script (described below) so that we can call your code. While the shell script is described below, the particular function to be implemented is shown like <code>this</code> in the requirements below. Note that handling output (such as which file to write it to) is likely easier done in the shell script rather than in your code.</p>
<p><strong>Output:</strong> Each command below should print out EXACTLY ONE LINE of output indicating the success (or failure) of the command. It will make your life much easier if this one line is from the source code, not the shell script.</p>
<p>The requirements are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Print the name of the cryptocurrency (<code>name</code>): this one command doesn't need to call your program; it can be part of the shell script instead.</li>
<li>Create the genesis block (<code>genesis</code>): this is the initial block in the block chain, and the block should always be the same. Come up with a fun quote!</li>
<li>Generate wallets (<code>generate</code>): this will create a public/private key set. It will output it (but how?)</li>
<li>Get wallet tag (<code>address</code>): this will print out the tag the public key for a given wallet, which is likely the hash of the public key. Note that it <em>only</em> prints out that tag (no other output). When the other commands talk about naming a wallet, this is what it actually means. You are welcome to use the first 16 bytes of the hash of the public key for this assignemnt; you don't need to use the entire hash.</li>
<li>Fund wallets (<code>fund</code>): this allows us to add as much money as we want to the wallet. While this is obviously not practical in the real world, it will allow us to test your program. Create a special case ID ('bigfoot', 'daddy_warbucks', or whatever) that your program knows to use as the source for a fund request, and also knows not to verify when handling verification, below. This means that 'bigfoot' will appear alongside the hash of the public keys as the source of funds.</li>
<li>Create a transaction statement (<code>transfer</code>): this statement will contain the sender, the recipient, the amount, and will have to be digitally signed with the private key of the wallet. Any reasonable format is fine for this, as long as the transaction statement is text and thus readable by a human. Note that this command does <em>NOT</em> add anything to the ledger. There will be four additional parameters to this command -- in order, they are: the sender, the recipient, the amount, and the name of the file to write the transaction record to.</li>
<li>Verify a transaction (<code>verify</code>): verify that a given transaction statement is valid, which will require checking the signature and also the availability of funds. Once verified, it should be added to the ledger. Once in the ledger, it becomes a transaction record.</li>
<li>Check a balance (<code>balance</code>): based on the transactions in the block chain AND ALSO in the ledger, compute the balance for the provided wallet.</li>
<li>Sign block (<code>sign</code>): this will form another block in the blockchain. The ledger will be emptied of transaction records, as they will all go into the current block being computed.</li>
<li>Validate the blockchain (<code>validate</code>): this should go through the entire block chain, validating each one. This means that starting with block 1 (the block <em>after</em> the genesis block), ensure that the hash for that block is correct in the next block.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="shell-script">Shell script</h3>
<p>Since different programming languages can be used, we are going to have you submit a shell script called <code>cryptomoney.sh</code> that we will use to test your code. Be sure to name it properly, as we will be calling this to test your code! Below is a sample shell script for you to adapt. In particular, it should have a separate case entry for <em>each</em> of the enumerated requirements, above. A sample line to call your program is given for Java, Python, and C/C++ programs. Your shell script can handle much of the output work for you, such as redirecting to a file so that your code only has to print to standard output.</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

# the first command-line parameter is in $1, the second in $2, etc.

case &quot;$1&quot; in

  genesis) java Money genesis &gt; block_0
           ;;

  generate) python3 money.py generate &gt; $2.key
           ;;

  fund) ./money fund $2
           ;;

  ## put the rest of the cases here, and end each one with the double semi-colon line

esac</code></pre>
<p>We realize that the bash syntax for case statements is pretty horrid, which is why we are providing this outline of the shell script. When calling the shell script, the function (genesis, generate, fund, etc.) will always be the first command line parameter (thus in $1). If any additional ones are needed, they will be after that (thus in $2, $3, etc.).</p>
<h3 id="sample-execution">Sample execution</h3>
<p>This is just meant to show the syntax -- it is not meant to be a full fledged testing suite of your homework. However, it does call each of the commands listed above. Note that the lines with the equals signs are setting variables to be used later on.</p>
<pre><code>./cryptomoney.sh name
./cryptomoney.sh genesis
./cryptomoney.sh generate alice.wallet.txt
export alice=`./cryptomoney.sh address alice.wallet.txt`
echo alice.wallet.txt wallet signature: $alice
./cryptomoney.sh fund $alice 100 01-alice-funding.txt
./cryptomoney.sh generate bob.wallet.txt
export bob=`./cryptomoney.sh address bob.wallet.txt`
echo bob.wallet.txt wallet signature: $bob
./cryptomoney.sh fund $bob 100 02-bob-funding.txt
./cryptomoney.sh transfer alice.wallet.txt $bob 12.5 03-alice-to-bob.txt
./cryptomoney.sh transfer bob.wallet.txt $alice 2.5 04-bob-to-alice.txt
./cryptomoney.sh verify 01-alice-funding.txt
./cryptomoney.sh verify 01-bob-funding.txt
./cryptomoney.sh verify 03-alice-to-bob.txt
./cryptomoney.sh verify 04-bob-to-alice.txt
cat ledger.txt
./cryptomoney.sh balance $alice
./cryptomoney.sh balance $bob
./cryptomoney.sh sign
./cryptomoney.sh validate</code></pre>
<h3 id="submission-requirements">Submission requirements</h3>
<p>You will submit exactly three files for this assignment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your source code file. All your code must be in a single file. We realize that a Java file may compile to multiple .class files, which is fine. As mentioned above, if you want to use a language other than C, C++, Java, or Python, please check with us first.</li>
<li>The shell script, which should be called <code>cryptomoney.sh</code>. We are going to call that script to test your entire code, so make sure it's named properly!</li>
<li>A Makefile that will compile your code when we call <code>make</code>, which will be called on submission. For languages that do not need compilation (such as Python), just put in a single <code>echo</code> statement so that <code>make</code> still runs properly.</li>
</ul>
