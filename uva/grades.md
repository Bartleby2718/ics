CS 3501: Course grades
======================

As per the [syllabus](syllabus.html) ([md](syllabus.md)), the grades were computed by:

- Programming and written assignments (35%)
- Two midterms (15% each)
- Final exam (25%)
- Class participation, pop quizzes (10%)


Participation and pop quizzes
-----------------------------

I did not give as many quizzes -- or take attendance -- as many times as I would have liked.  There were only three quizzes, and only one attendance day, and having so few would cause missing any one (or doing poorly on any one) to have a particularly large impact.  So everybody got a base 5/10 for the participation (think of this as like a mini course curve), and the remaining quizzes and attendance day would make up the other 5/10.  Note that if you had a valid excuse for missing a quiz or attendance day, then this was taken into account, and the non-free 5 points was computed with this in mind.  This is listed as your 'participation' grade in the course gradebook, and was rounded to the nearest 0.01.  I realize this does not necessarily capture all the ways that people could have participated in the course.

Rounding
--------

Yes, we round grades. Note that `round(x) == floor(x+0.5)`. So we added 0.5 points to everybody's curve to take into account rounding. Note that this means rounding is already taken care of, so if you get an 89.9999999999999999999, it's still a B+, no matter how many times you ask - you don't get to round a second time (in reality, it was an 89.49).


Course curve
------------

**The overall course got a curve of 3.5 points.**  With rounding, that is an additional **4.0 points** to add to your final course average.  This was to make up for some harsh grading on the exams and homeworks, and to bring the average of the course up a bit.  Thus, add 3.5 to your course average from the [course gradebook](https://libra.cs.virginia.edu/~pedagogy/gradebook.php), and that round that up if necessary.  Or add 4.0 to your course average, and don't round it.  

We followed the standard decade curve, as shown in the table below.


| Minimum course average | Letter grade |
|------------------------|--------------|
| 60 | D- |
| 63 | D |
| 67 | D+ |
| 70 | C- |
| 73 | C |
| 77 | C+ |
| 80 | B- |
| 83 | B |
| 87 | B+ |
| 90 | A- |
| 93 | A |
| 98 | A+ |

Note that the A+ range range follows a slightly different pattern -- it is the top few students in the class by average, and ended up being 98.0 this semester.
