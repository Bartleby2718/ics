ICS: Written HW: Celebrity Visit
================================

[Go up to the ICS HW page](index.html) ([md](index.md))

Jason Belford, the CISO (Chief Information Security Officer) for UVa, will be visiting the class on Wednesday, April 17th, to give a brief overview of what he does as CISO, and to answer questions.

This homework is to generate two *good* questions that you could (potentially) ask him.  With the number of students in the class, obviously not everybody will be able to ask questions.

Write your questions in a TEXT FILE, and name it `mst3k.txt` (replace mst3k with your userid).

This must be submitted by the end of the day on Tuesday, April 16th.  Late submissions will not be accepted on this assignment!
