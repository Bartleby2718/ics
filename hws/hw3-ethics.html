<p><a href="index.html">Go up to the ICS HW page</a> (<a href="index.md">md</a>)</p>
<p>You will want to see the <a href="../uva/hw-policies.html">homeworks policies page</a> (<a href="../uva/hw-policies.md">md</a>) for formatting and other details. The due dates are listed on the <a href="../uva/index.html">UVa course page</a> (<a href="../uva/index.md">md</a>).</p>
<h3 id="assignment">Assignment</h3>
<p>You will need to be familiar with the content of the <a href="../slides/ethics.html#/">Ethics slide set</a>, as well as the <a href="https://www.scu.edu/media/ethics-center/technology-ethics/IntroToCybersecurityEthics.pdf">An Introduction to Cybersecurity Ethics</a> PDF. Specifically, you will have wanted to have <em>read</em> that PDF.</p>
<p>For this assignment, you are to write a essay on <em>one</em> of the cybersecurity challenges listed in part 2 of the <a href="https://www.scu.edu/media/ethics-center/technology-ethics/IntroToCybersecurityEthics.pdf">An Introduction to Cybersecurity Ethics</a> PDF. However, it must be one for which there are arguments on both sides (or all sides, if there are more than 2 sides) as to which path is the correct one ethically.</p>
<p>Which one to choose? That's up to you. However, please copy and paste the challenge scenario into your answer (this does not count against your 500 word limit).</p>
<p>Your essay should discuss the pros and cons of each of the sides. It must conclude with a decision that you make. We aren't going to judge you on <em>which</em> decision you make, as long as said decision is based on the pros and cons stated in the essay.</p>
<p>The essay must be 500 words or less. That's about 1 page worth of content. Note that any header information (name, title, date, class, etc.) do not count toward the word limit. References, if you use any, also do not count against this limit. <strong><em>If it is over 500 words, then we will not grade it and give you a zero!</em></strong> The <a href="../uva/hw-policies.html">HW policies page</a> (<a href="../uva/hw-policies.md">md</a>) discusses this in a bit more detail.</p>
<p>We are looking for a well thought out ethical argument. So stating that something is bad without explaining why is not what we are looking for. Thus, &quot;it's bad because I was taught that way&quot; does not explain <em>why</em> it's bad, only that it <em>is</em> bad. We can tell if you are just giving us a load of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit">BS</a>, and we will give you a zero if you do that.</p>
<p>Did you read the section about fluff in the <a href="../uva/hw-policies.html">homeworks policies page</a> (<a href="../uva/hw-policies.md">md</a>)? When one is grading dozens of these assignments, one becomes a great fluff detector, and will mark your assignment down -- or give you a zero -- for it. It's a waste of your time and also a waste of our time.</p>
<h3 id="submission">Submission</h3>
<p>Please ensure that you follow <em>all</em> of these requirements:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>You will submit <em>both</em> a PDF and a .docx file of your essay. If you are not using Microsoft Word, then just export your final copy to a Word file (.docx format) -- all modern word processors can do this.</li>
<li>Please put your word count at the top of your essay. As mentioned above, any header info (name, class, date, title, etc.), as well as references, do not count toward this word count. And the required text &quot;499 words&quot; doesn't count, either, of course (replace 499 with your actual word count).</li>
<li>Is your essay it 500 words or less? If not, you are going to get a zero!</li>
<li>You <strong><em>MUST</em></strong> name your files userid.pdf and userid.docx where 'userid' is your UVa userid.</li>
<li>Please copy and paste the challenge scenario, as listed in the PDF, into your answer (this does not count against your 500 word limit).</li>
