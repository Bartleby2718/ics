## First, a definition...
> malware: software that is intended to damage or disable computers and computer systems



## Costs of Malware
- Cost of malware (worldwide):
  - 1997: $3.3 billion ([source](http://www.computereconomics.com/article.cfm?id=1225))
  - 2006: $13.3 billion ([source](http://www.computereconomics.com/article.cfm?id=1225))
  - 2014: $491 billion ([source](https://www.scmagazine.com/breaches-malware-to-cost-491-billion-in-2014-study-says/article/539302/))
- Companies often cover up the worst cases
- Does not include cost of security measures



## Malware Costs: Example 1
- April 1999: [CIH (Chernobyl) virus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIH_virus)
  - Overwrites first megabyte of the hard drive with zeros, then overwrites the BIOS
  - Only affects Windows 95, 98, and ME
- $250 million lost in one day in Korea alone; widespread across Asia
  - Estimated $1 billion in damages in total
- Hard to quantify cost of lost files, time spent reinstalling OS and applications, etc.



## Malware Costs: Example 2
- February 2001 mass mailer: [Anna Kournikova computer virus/worm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Kournikova_(computer_virus%29)
  - Visual Basic script attached to email, based on [LoveLetter worm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loveletter)
  - Enticed people to open it promising a picture of a popular and pretty tennis star
    - Social engineering!
  - Did little damage, though
  - The creator didn't know how to program, but used a virus kit



## Malware Costs: Example 3
- 2010 / 2011: [Stuxnet worm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet)
  - By far the most advanced piece of malware ever created at that point
  - It's goal (and it succeeded!) was to cripple Iran's nuclear enrichment
    - Said program was set back by 1-2 years
  - Authors have not come forward, but speculation is a joint Israel / US team



## Malware Costs: Example 4
- [Ashley Madison data breach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashley_Madison_data_breach) in 2015
  - This is the site that peddled extra-marital affairs
  - They threatened to release the site's DB info unless the site was closed down
    - No ransom was requested!
  - They did reveal the information, which led to embarrassment and some suicides
  - Interestingly, almost all of the "female" members were bots...



## Malware Costs: Example 5
- [2016 US election hacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2016_United_States_elections)
  - "The US intelligence community has concluded with high confidence that the Russian government interfered in the ... election"
  - Whether it affected the outcome is up for debate
	- And not one I want to engage in now...
  - But the fact that they were able to interfere is worrisome
- Interfering in elections is a common tactic; the US has done so a lot as well ([source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/10/13/the-long-history-of-the-u-s-interfering-with-elections-elsewhere/))



## Malware Costs: Example 6
- [NotPetya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petya_(malware%29) in 2017
  - Infected Ukrainian companies through a back door put into a Ukrainian version of a TurboTax-like software
    - Companies with Ukrainian subsidiaries were infected through their corporate network
  - This was a "the equivalent of using a nuclear bomb to achieve a small tactical victory"
  - There is a good [Wired article](https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/) on it



## Malware Costs: Conclusion
- Computer viruses and other security attacks are very costly
- Computer security is a hot field today; many career and research opportunities for graduates from this course
- Knowledge of security issues is sensitive and carries an ethical responsibility with it
- ...but how can you write a detection software for a virus that does not exist yet?



## There are also policy motivations
- US bills [SOPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act) / [PIPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PROTECT_IP_Act) from 2011 were intended to hinder piracy, it would allow serious security problems
  - There have been many such attempts since
- US drone fleet virus (see articles [here](http://www.tgdaily.com/security-features/58927-virus-infects-us-military-drones) and [here](https://www.wired.com/2011/10/virus-hits-drone-fleet/))
  - And people thought viruses were a thing of the past!

# Course Information
  </textarea></section>

  <section data-markdown data-separator="^\n\n\n"><textarea>
## Course Objectives
- Understand the ethical and policy context for cybersecurity in today's society
- Understand how to better safeguard one's personal computer
- Understand the basics of advanced topics in cybersecurity including encryption, digital forensics, binary exploits, and networks
- Understand the modern concepts in cybersecurity attacks and prevention



## Course Purpose
- This course is meant to be a general introduction to cybersecurity
- It will eventually be a pre-req for all the other cybersecurity courses at UVa
  - But not yet, since this is the first semester the class is being taught



## Content duplication
- In the past, students have taken many different courses as their first cybersecurity course
  - This led to a duplication of topics, including: encryption, networking basics, etc.
- That content is being moved into this course
  - Since it will shortly be a pre-req for all those other courses



## Content duplication
- Thus, if you have taken any of those classes:
  - CS 4730: Defense Against the Dark Arts
  - CS 4760: Network security
  - CS 4501: Topics in Cryptography
- You will see repeated content



## Repeated content specifics
Repeated content:
- From CS 4730 (Defense Against the Dark Arts): terminology, encryption, SQL & XSS, networking basics, Stuxnet
- From CS 4760 (Network security): networking basics, encryption, securing networks
- From CS 4501 (Topics in Cryptography): encryption



## Course Sources
- I am not, in fact, the first to create an Introduction to Cybersecurity course
  - Some of this course's content will be based on [UMich EECS 388](https://www.eecs.umich.edu/courses/eecs388.f13//index.html)
    - Intel funded them to create a course under a [CC BY-SA](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license
  - Other parts will come from online sources
    - The ethics part from [here](https://www.scu.edu/ethics/focus-areas/technology-ethics/resources/an-introduction-to-cybersecurity-ethics/), for example



## Class Information
- Prerequisites: CS 2150 with a grade of C- or higher
- Grades
  - Two midterms (15% each)
    - Monday, October 1st, in lecture
    - Wednesday, October 31st, in lecture
  - Final exam (25%)
  - Homeworks (35%)
  - Class participation, pop quizzes (10%)
- I reserve the right to adjust the percentages based on the number of assignments and quizzes, and other factors



## Final exam
- It's on Friday, December 14th, from 2 pm to 5 pm
  - I didn't get to choose the date and time...
- You can't take it early, so please don't ask
- You can't take it late, either



## Class Information
- No textbooks required
  - They get outdated too quickly!
  - Readings will be via provided PDFs and online materials
- Late homework is docked 25% per day (or fraction thereof)
- Thus, more than 72 hours late will receive a zero 



## Us and you
- My office hours are M/W from 1:00-2:30; they start next week
- We also have TAs for this course
- I avoid e-mailing the class; announcements will be discussed each day in lecture
- To contact me, please use the support tickets tool via the "Course Tools" tool in Collab
  - Or directly via https://libra.cs.virginia.edu/~pedagogy/
  - It will allow for a much faster response time
- We'll also have Piazza as well



## Course Materials
- They are kept in a github repo: https://github.com/aaronbloomfield/ics
  - Released under a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) (CC BY-SA) license
- That repo is viewable online at http://aaronbloomfield.github.io/ics/



## Collab
- We'll use for only a few things:
  - Quick login to the submission system
  - Piazza link
  - Large file downloads
  - Not much else...
- It will be available later this week
- Recall that most of the course materials are in the [github repo](https://github.com/aaronbloomfield/ics)



## Tentative schedule
- Too long to list here, but a list of topics we will cover is shown at the end of the [course syllabus](../uva/syllabus.html)



## Homeworks
- Each module will generally have two assignments
  - A written homework, submitted as a PDF
    - Will consist of writing, math, and short programs
  - A programming assignment; source code will be submitted
- Please read the [homework policies](../uva/hw-policies.html) page, as you are going to be bound by it!



## Completing the homeworks
- You can use a VirtualBox image we will provide
- You can use a NX/NoMachine account that we will provide
- You can run it on your own computer



## Readings
- There is no assigned textbook
- However, there will be readings assigned
- These readings may have pop quizzes to test that you actually read it
  - If you miss class, then you get a zero for the quiz!



## Politics
- Some of the discussion in this class will be regarding politics
  - Especially the policy discussion late next week
- Although I have strong political opinions, I have always maintained strict political neutrality when teaching my classes
  - If you ever feel this is not the case, please let me know!
- That being said, if something is stupid, I'm going to say so (generally something technology related)
  - I don't consider that politics -- just common sense



## Honor policy
- All assignments are individual assignments
- You can talk at a high level about the assignment
- You cannot look at anybody else's code prior to either of your submissions
  - Including a later submission!

# Ethics
  </textarea></section>
      
  <section data-markdown data-separator="^\n\n\n"><textarea>
## Computer Ethics
- We must teach how attacks upon computer systems work in order to teach defenses against attacks
- Information about attacks must NEVER be used to attack any computer system in any way



## Ethics Pledge
- You will have to read and sign the ethics pledge
- It should not be difficult to follow
- Ethics will be covered in more detail later
- You cannot continue in the course without signing the [ethics pledge](../uva/ethics-pledge.pdf)!
- I'll collect them in the next class



## Ethics Pledge Points
- Unauthorized use of computer resources is forbidden
- Even malware that does nothing but copy itself uses resources
- Don't ever rationalize that a system owner won't object to your actions; ask permission
  - If you are afraid to ask permission, it must be forbidden!



## Example: [1988 Morris Worm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_worm)
- Creator rationalized that the worm did no damage
  - It only copied itself from system to system over the Internet
- BUT: Copying monopolized system resources until they had to be shut down
- Worm reached 10% of entire internet
- Creator did not realize it would be that resource-intensive
- Creator was convicted of felonies!
  - And is now a professor at MIT.  Go figure!



## Morris Worm Lessons
- Consequences of a virus or worm cannot always be foreseen
- Severe damage can be done without destroying data
- Excessive resource usage is destructive enough to be criminal



## Criminal Prosecution
- Attackers have been prosecuted for:
  - Stealing passwords, even if never used 
  - Copying copyrighted materials
  - Accessing confidential data, even if it was never used for harmful purposes
  - Entering a system without permission, causing sys admins to spend time tracking them and securing the system, even without otherwise causing harm
- Moral: Don't assume it is legally safe to do any of the above



## Ethics Violations
- Violations by students endanger our ability to offer this course
- As a result, they will be treated severely
  - UJC (University Judiciary Committee)
  - Course grades
  - Criminal prosecution



## ACM Code of Ethics
- ACM is the primary professional organization for computer scientists
- The entire code is available at http://www.acm.org/about/code-of-ethics 



## Ethics Questions
- Scenario: John Doe attempts to guess the password of a user of a system on which John Doe has no account. After a few guesses, he succeeds, but finds nothing of interest on the system and logs off.
- Q1: Has he committed a crime?
- Q2: Are his actions analogous to any common crime not involving computers?
