- So that exam wasn't all that popular...
  - I got some really nasty anonymous feedback about it
- Grading is moving along:
  - Grades for quizzes 2&3, and HWs 5 (movie night) and 6 (hashing) have been returned; regrades open for 10 days
  - Grades for HW 4 (RSA) will be out later today
  - We are aiming to have the exam graded by next week
  - HW 7 (buffer overflow) is in queue after the exam
  - I am working on getting the grading guidelines posted to Collab as well
- My office hours are M/W 1:00-2:30
  - Helen (the ugrad TA) has hers from 10:00-noon in Olsson 018
- Stuff that is due:
  - HW 8 is due next Monday
- [Anonymous feedback](https://collab.its.virginia.edu/portal/site/2461b270-0d49-4478-adb0-7dbaa77074e8/tool-reset/4e78ec1e-13b4-4b23-b479-9d1ceb0c6f58)!  It's through Collab

## Midterm 2
- I'd like to move the date of the second midterm
  - From: Wednesday, October 31st
  - To: Monday, November 5th
- Because this was stated in the syllabus, I don't feel right in just changing it without all y'all's input
- Why?
  - I screwed up in picking the date -- it should have been later in the semester
  - It will allow us to get through the next module (networks) in its entirety before the exam
  - It is currently a bit to close to midterm 1, so with not as much new material, it will focus on a very small number of lectures
- Thoughts?
- If you are OPPOSED to this, please let me know by Sunday night
  - I emailed the class about this as well
