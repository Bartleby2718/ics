### RSA homework files

The files in here are all linked to from the
[RSA homework](../hw-rsa.html) ([md](../hw-rsa.md))

The [RSA.java](RSA.java) skeleton code was formatted with:

```
astyle --style=java --pad-header RSA.java
```

The [RSA.java.html](RSA.java.html) file was then created with:

```
source-highlight -d RSA.java
```

The [html](html/) directory was created by running `doxygen`.
