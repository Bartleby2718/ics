# Ethical Questions
  </textarea>
</section>
    
<section data-markdown data-separator="^\n\n\n">
  <textarea data-template>
## Question 1: What if Google were out to get you?
- Imagine that you were the mortal enemy of Larry Page or Sergey Brin
  - The founders of Google
- How much damage could they do to you?
  - Control the information that you see?
  - How much does Google know about you?
  - How much access to your private digital life does Google have, beyond Gmail?
- There are few laws that regulate any of this!



## Question 1: What if Google were out to get you?
- So why doesn't Google do this?
  - Well, Brin and Page are not evil (although this is debated: [1](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/21/google-seems-to-have-removed-most-mentions-of-dont-be-evil-from-its-code-of-conduct.html), [2](https://www.engadget.com/2018/05/24/google-will-always-do-evil/), [3](https://www.infoworld.com/article/2610434/cringely/google--evil--you-have-no-idea.html), etc.)
  - Actually, they do [do some of these things in other countries](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/01/technology/china-google-censored-search-engine.html)
- Beyond not being evil, few people would use their services if they were known to do these things



## Question 2: [Trolley Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem)
<img alt="trolley problem" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/Trolley_problem.png" style="height:200px">
- You see a runaway trolley moving toward five tied-up people lying on the tracks
- You are next to a lever that controls a switch
- If you pull the lever, the trolley will be redirected onto a side track and the five people on the main track will be saved



## Question 2: [Trolley Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem)
<img alt="trolley problem" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/Trolley_problem.png" style="height:200px">
- However, there is a single person lying on the side track
  - Option 1: Do nothing and allow the trolley to kill the five people on the main track
  - Option 2: Pull the lever, diverting the trolley onto the side track where it will kill one person
- Which is the most ethical option?



## Question 3: Another variation
- Imagine you somehow knew that an individual would inadvertently kill another person
- Would you kill them to prevent this?
  - Assume that nobody would have this foreknowledge, and you would be branded a murderer
<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">What if the person would inadvertently kill 5 others?  10?  100?  A million?</li>
<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">What if this were inadvertent?</li><ul><li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">Meaning the individual would murder those other(s)</li></ul>



## Question 4: FBI & Apple Encryption Dispute
- The 2 who caused the [2015 San Bernardino attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_San_Bernardino_attack) that killed 14 used encryption on their iPhone 5C
  - The FBI was unable to crack it at the time
- The FBI ordered Apple to *write a program* to crack it, but Apple refused
  - It could allow mass surveillance and persecution of others
    - Especially if it leaked out of US control
- Apple refused, citing privacy and ethics
- This is the [FBI-Apple encryption dispute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI%E2%80%93Apple_encryption_dispute)



## Question 4: FBI & Apple Encryption Dispute
- What were Apple's ethical requirements?
  - While one can agree or disagree with Apple, there are definitely arguments on both sides
- Ultimately, it was discovered that one can hack into these phones via booting it through the USB port
  - This "feature" has been removed on more recent iPhones
- However, Apple's [appeal to public more about protecting market share than privacy, says UAlberta ethics professor](https://www.folio.ca/apple-vs-fbi-and-the-ethics-of-encryption/)



## Question 5: Gov't Leaks
- Are leaks from within the government unethical?
  - Such as leaks from within the White House, etc.
- Consider how partisan of a world we live in...
- For members of the *same* party as the president:
  - *Yes, they are unethical!  Those perpetrators should be caught and thrown in jail!*
- For members of the *opposite* party as the president:
  - *No, they are not!  They are revealing what an awful regime is running the country!*
- This has happened to previous administrations as well, to varying degrees



## Lessons Learned
- Question 1: Google
  - Companies with a lot of power can do greater damage with unethical choices
- Question 2: Trolley
  - Not all of these have correct answers (or even widely accepted answers)
- Question 3: Stopping a murderer
  - All these questions have thresholds




## Lessons Learned
- Question 4: FBI & Apple
  - Allowing a "crack" on encryption can have unintended consequences
  - Companies that state they are making the ethical choice may only be making the best financial choice
- Question 5: 
  - Reasonable people will have different views as to what is "ethical"

# Ethical Issues

## What is Ethics?
> Ethics is a branch of philosophy that involves systematizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong conduct

- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics)

> the most important thing is not life, but the good life

- Socrates



## Ethics helps stabilize society
- Obvious examples: don't kill, don't steal, etc.
- As a result, all major religions and societies have these rules
  - Secular and sacred laws follow these ethics: don't kill, don't steal, etc.
- They help us live a "good life", as per Socrates
- Separate from moral arguments, ethics is a matter of self-preservation
  - Keep others from harming you



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img-800" -->
## With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility
![spider man image](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61yJKZIJqjL.jpg)
- Technology gives us great<br>power
  - To accomplish a lot,<br>to harm others
- The quote is [more likely<br>from the period of the<br>French Revolution](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2015/07/23/great-power/)



## Technological Dependence
- We are increasingly becoming more dependent on technology
- If it were used in ways that could harm us, then that would have a much greater effect than it would have decades ago
  - See: [Facebook and the 2016 election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media_in_the_United_States_presidential_election,_2016)



## Inability to keep up
- With the rapid change of technological advancement, it is not realistic to have laws force ethical behavior
  - Lawmakers don't understand technology
  - Change is faster than laws can realistically be passed
  - Poor law wording can have wide-ranging negative effects
- Thus, various organizations have their own ethics policies, including the [ACM Code of Ethics](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics) and [IEEE's technological ethics division](https://techethics.ieee.org/)



## Ethics and Cybersecurity
- Design of cybersecurity systems seeks to protect:
  - Integrity
  - Functionality
  - Reliability
  - Etc.
- As designers, we want to ensure that we are designing systems that:
  - Are as safe as possible
  - Do not have intentional backdoors or means for improper surveillance



## How can harm result?
- Beyond intentional backdoors and such...
- From poor programming or deliberate unethical choices
  - Note that the poor design choices are considered unethical when people depend on the system in some way
  - People have gone to jail for poor design of systems, both computer and otherwise, in these situations
- Can you go to jail for coding?



## How can harm result?
- Can you go to jail for coding?
- Note that this is poor programming to the point of being *negligent*
  - Not just a coding mistake
- However, it is ethical to ensure that your system works via tests and testing suites



## Ethical Issues in Cybersecurity
- Harm to privacy
- Harm to property
- Cybersecurity costs
- Transparency and disclosure
- Roles, duties, and interests



## Harm to privacy
- Beyond just embarrassment at your porn viewing history, that is...
- Consider:
  - Identity theft, including financial account theft
    - The most common of these, since there is money to be obtained through this
  - Social ostracisation
  - Blackmail
  - Extortion
  - Theft of state secrets



## Harm to property
- Loss of funds from a financial account
- Perhaps digital property (loss of data)
- Some machines can be damaged via malware; this happened as early as 1999 via the [Chernobyl virus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIH_virus)
- Connected weapon systems can damage property (and people!)
  - Think of [Skynet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skynet_(Terminator%29) from the [Terminator franchise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_(franchise%29)
  - Luckily not many exist (yet)...



## Cybersecurity costs
- Too much security, and the system becomes unusable
  - Consider a system that needs to be accessed quickly: emergency response systems
- Too little, and the system is too insecure
- This decision is an ethical one, balancing between these two factors
  - Companies hire [business ethicists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_ethics) for this purpose
- There is one-size-fits-all correct answer to this!



## Transparency and disclosure
- If a vulnerability is found, how soon to notify?
  - Perhaps not all that soon if it's hard to find, or if no patch yet exists
  - Otherwise, notify right away
- This decision is an ethical one, balancing between these two factors
- There is one-size-fits-all correct answer to this!



## Roles, duties, and interests
- Consider conflicts of interest:
  - Wanting to release an encryption vulnerability to help promote a better algorithm
  - Hiring an ethically deficient person to try to turn them to the light side of the Force
- Are these ethically allowed?
- This decision is an ethical one, balancing between these two factors
- There is one-size-fits-all correct answer to this!
