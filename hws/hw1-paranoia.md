ICS: Written Homework 1: Rational Paranoia
==========================================

[Go up to the ICS HW page](index.html) ([md](index.md))

You will want to see the [homeworks policies page](../uva/hw-policies.html)
([md](../uva/hw-policies.md)) for formatting and other details.  The due
dates are listed on the [UVa course page](../uva/index.html)
([md](../uva/index.md)).

### Assignment

For each of the four scenarios (as explained below), imagine that you
are in charge of security. Apply the security mindset (discussed in
the [security slide set](../slides/security.html#/)) to answer these
questions:

- *What assets are important for you to protect?*
- *What security threats will you choose to defend against?*
- *What countermeasures can you justify, in terms of costs and benefits?*
	
Answer each of the above in the form of a bulleted list, with brief
justifications or explanations as necessary. State any critical
assumptions you decide to make. Your grade will be based on the
thoroughness, realism, and thoughtfulness of your analysis.

Pick two of the following scenarios. (If you answer more, we’ll
ignore the last one(s))

...

Choose another scenario from everyday life that we haven’t discussed
in class.  Your choice may be directly related to computer security,
but it doesn’t have to be.
