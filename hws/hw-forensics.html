<h1 id="ics-programming-homework-forensics">ICS: Programming Homework: Forensics</h1>
<p><a href="index.html">Go up to the ICS HW page</a> (<a href="index.md">md</a>)</p>
<p>You will want to see the <a href="../uva/hw-policies.html">homeworks policies page</a> (<a href="../uva/hw-policies.md">md</a>) for formatting and other details. The due dates are listed on the <a href="../uva/index.html">UVa course page</a> (<a href="../uva/index.md">md</a>).</p>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Mae Cartly led a very secluded life. You knew little about her, or what she did. She rented an apartment across from you, and you saw her occasionally -- but probably spoke a total of 5 words to her in the two years that you lived across from each other.</p>
<p>Suddenly, though, she disappeared. You could tell that something was up as the lights in her apartment no longer went on at night. The police were called, but the could find no indication of foul play, so they closed the criminal part of the case and listed her as a missing person.</p>
<p>Her sister Laila showed up a few weeks later, and struck up a conversation with you. Laila worried that something was &quot;up&quot; with Mae's disappearance, although she had no idea what it was. She searched the apartment, but to no avail. The only thing that Laila was not able to properly search was Mae's computer.</p>
<p>Laila has asked you to look into her computer to see what you can find out. You took an image of the hard drive, which uses Linux, and you have that to work from.</p>
<p>Laila would like you to help her find out (1) where Mae went, and (2) who she can contact about Mae's sudden departure.</p>
<p>But you have no idea what to look for...</p>
<h3 id="assignment">Assignment</h3>
<p>Find out what's &quot;up&quot;.</p>
<p>Spoiler: there is obviously a story that this disk image can tell, otherwise there wouldn't be this assignment.</p>
<p>The intent is for you to use Autopsy / SleuthKit for this assignment, as well as some command-line commands.</p>
<h3 id="details">Details</h3>
<p>You can get a copy of the hard drive image by going to <a href="https://libra.cs.virginia.edu/forensics/" class="uri">https://libra.cs.virginia.edu/forensics/</a> -- you will have to use Netbadge to log in. <strong>You can not use somebody else's disk image!</strong> If it says that your image is not yet ready, try again in an hour or so. The image was compressed with gzip -- if your operating system does not natively support it, then you can use <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/">7-zip</a> to extract it. The compressed .gz file is 3.7 Gb in size, and the uncompressed image is 9.0 Gb in size.</p>
<p>This image was designed using Linux (it's an ext4 file system). However, you can do this homework on any host OS. This can also be done on the VirtualBox Linux image provided for the class. Due to the size of the image file for this homework, you will either need to increase the disk size (see the bottom of <a href="https://uva-cs.github.io/pdr/tutorials/01-intro-unix/vb-image-details.html">here</a> for how to do that) or mount a shared folder through VirtualBox, which will allow the guest OS (Linux in the VirtualBox image) to access the file on your host OS.</p>
<h3 id="tools-allowed">Tools allowed</h3>
<p>The intent of this assignment is for you to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy_(software%29)">Autopsy</a> / <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sleuth_Kit">SleuthKit</a>. You can install them on your VirtualBox image via:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get install autopsy sleuthkit</code></pre>
<p>You then have to run autopsy as root:</p>
<pre><code>sudo autopsy</code></pre>
<p>You can then view the UI via <a href="http://localhost:9999/autopsy" class="uri">http://localhost:9999/autopsy</a>.</p>
<p>You can install it on other OSes (Windows, Mac, etc.) by viewing the details at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy_(software%29)">Autopsy's website</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to Autopsy and SleuthKit, you can use the standard tools that come with an operating system -- in particular, file explorers, searching contents of files for text, etc.</p>
<p><strong>You may NOT use any OTHER existing digital forensic tools for this assignment,</strong> beyond the standard OS commands installed by default when the OS is installed (and Autopsy / SleuthKit, of course). You are to use your knowledge of forensics, the <a href="../slides/forensics.html#/">forensics slide set</a>, and the existing OS commands. In particular, the &quot;Techniques&quot; section of that slide set has the necessary techniques to find what can be found on this disk image. We recommend learning a few commands: <code>strings</code> and <code>grep</code> are going to be particularly useful for Linux. You can Google for equivalents in other OSes. Note that some of the information on the disk image was specifically designed to NOT be able to be (easily) found with Autopsy / SleuthKit.</p>
<h3 id="deliverable">Deliverable</h3>
<p>The deliverable is a PDF report, named mst3k.pdf (change 'mst3k' to your userid).</p>
<p>The report will be divided into a number of parts. So that we can easily figure out what you found out, please make it clear which part of your report are for which part.</p>
<p>Part 1 is the two questions of Laila's to answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where did Mae go?</li>
<li>Who can Laila speak to, locally, to find out more?</li>
</ul>
<p>The second part of this report should contain as much information as you can determine about where Mae is, and as much of the story as you can determine. Note that you will be able to get partial credit based on what you find, even if you don't find everything.</p>
<p>The third part of this report should contain the information that you found, and how you found it. The how-you-found-it is is important, as there are a multiple ways to find each piece of information. Please be brief, but concise -- we have to read through all of these, and we don't want to read through pages and pages of content when it can be summarized in a much shorter amount.</p>
<p>The fourth part is to comment on this assignment:</p>
<ul>
<li>What did you think of it? We are looking for an honest answer here, not a sycophantic one.</li>
<li>Was there anything that we screwed up on? Specifically, was there a particular piece of evidence in which we did not properly hide something? Or did we give something away?</li>
<li>Give one (or more!) suggestions for additional content to hide, or where to hide it, or improvements to the story.</li>
</ul>
<p>The PDF report is the only item to submit.</p>
