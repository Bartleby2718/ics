## A few (more) media updates
- [1.3M records stolen in hack of Georgia Tech database](https://siliconangle.com/2019/04/02/1-3m-records-stolen-hack-georgia-tech-database/)
  - Yes, that's 1.3 *million*
  - "The data accessed and stolen included the names, addresses, Social Security numbers and birthdates of current and former faculty, students, staff and student applicants."
  - Interestingly, if you do a [Google search for "georgia tech sql injection attack"](https://www.google.com/search?q=georgia+tech+sql+injection+attack) you get a whole lot of links about how to prevent them...
- [Kremlin Moves Toward Control of Internet, Raising Censorship Fears](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/world/europe/russia-internet-censorship.html)
  - All external Internet connections must go through Roskomnadzor, the state communications watchdog
  - This will allow easy censoring of non-Russian websites similar to what China does

- [Exam 1](../exams/exam1-s19.pdf) has been returned: avg was 42.67/48 (88.9%), so no curve
  - Regrades open until the end of March  -- while I am not planning on having a frivolous regrade policy, I reserve the right to penalize regrades that I feel are abusing the system (i.e., just pining for points)
- Exam 2 will be next Friday, March 29th
- Updated VB image: a bunch of bug fixes, updated packages, etc.
  - You can get it [here](https://virginia.box.com/s/lrlrokq3hul8lr5hgdymio3ppw9to60b) -- the same link as before -- and extract it over your old image
    - But if you have saved work on your old image, that will be lost...
  - Old image?  Try running: `/bin/rm -f /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/02proxy`
- Grading and homeworks
  - Grades for [HW 4: RSA](../hws/hw-rsa.html) and [HW 5: Hashing](../hws/hw-hashing.html) have been returned
    - I am going to release a partial RSA testing harness, and then have a further discussion about RSA regrades
  - [HW 6: buffer overflow](../hws/hws-buffer.html) is out to be graded
  - [HW 7: movie night](../hws/hw-movie-night.html) and [HW 8: networks](../hws/hw-networks.html) are due today
    - HW 8 had had two parts removed, but if you did the WEP cracking part, please put that in there
  - [HW 9: SQL, XSS, and CSRF](../hws/hw-sql-xss-csrf.html) is ready and is due Wednesday, April 3rd
- [Anonymous feedback](https://collab.its.virginia.edu/portal/site/bbcd086f-9d6d-405b-81e0-339d9cc53a08/tool/1453de85-6853-45de-9972-615ade259377/main)! It's through Collab
- Today we will likely finish [SQL, XSS, and CSRF](../slides/sql-xss-csrf.html#/) (starting [here](../slides/sql-xss-csrf.html#/3/12)) then start [web security](../slides/web-security.html#/)
