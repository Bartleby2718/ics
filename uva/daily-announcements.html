## Lecture 3: Monday, September 3rd
- New room!  THN E303 has capacity for 100 students, 20 more than Olsson 005
  - But this room feels like an airplane...
  - That means the course cap will shortly be set to 100
- My office hours are M/W 1:00-2:30
  - TA office hours will begin later this week or next week
- Stuff that is due:
  - Readings due today: [ACM Code of Ethics](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics), [Reflections on Trusting Trust](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=358210), and [Morris Worm Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_worm)
  - Homework due Thursday: [HW 1: Rational Paranoia](../hws/hw-paranoia.html)
    - You will likely want to wait until the [security mindset slide set](../slides/security-mindset.html#/) has been gone over in lecture
- We are going to do encryption next, instead of ethics & policy
  - The reason is for the upcoming homeworks...
- The submission system (including support tickets) is now open
